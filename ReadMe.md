There are two ways to run this app:
Run the server separately, either
    a. From it's own repo, or
    b. From its' location in this repo, at app/src/main/java/dtu/dk/introDistributedProjectApp/server/Main.java 
Then, run at least two clients (including the one that is potentially hosting) and make them join.

Minimum number of players can be configured easily in the source code, but playing alone is lonely.

If running the client in android studio to an external server on the same computer, the desired IP address is by default 10.0.2.2

Source code is hosted on GitHub:
Client (This repo): https://github.com/luucmeldgaard/IntroDistributedProjectApp
and Server (A subsection of this repo): https://github.com/s224268/introDistributedSystemsProject
